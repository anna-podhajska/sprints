Command Line is a "program" which may be used to do a variety of tasks without using a mouse.

By typing commands in the command line, one can for example start (run) other computer programs. Command Line can also be used to manage files and to navigate between them, for example to change a file name, to move files, or to create a new directory.

It can also be used to display some computer functions as for example to view all running programs in the background (processes), or to run some programming languages, as for example Python.

It looks abstract but in fact it is a very useful tool that seems to be able to do pretty much everything.

It also reminds me of AmadeusGDS system command line terminal!


10 Terminal commands:

cd "directoryname or path" -> change directory
cd .. -> move up one dir (cd . is current dir)
mkdir -> create a new dir
touch filename.sth -> create a new empty file
atom filename.sth -> open a file in atom
pwd -> print working dir
ls -> list/ show me files and directories in current dir
ls -al  -> list all files incl .hiddenOnes
rm filename -> remove file (rm -rf  removes folder with content)
mv filename.sth Newfilename.sth -> change file name
